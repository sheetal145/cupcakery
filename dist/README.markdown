# Expanding card page transition effect

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/rachsmith/pen/PWxoLN](https://codepen.io/rachsmith/pen/PWxoLN).

That thing where the card expands into the background,  no libraries, commented.

Please note: this code is in no way ready to be used as is in production on your website. It will need to be adapted to be cross browser compliant & accessible. I just wanted to share how one might go about this effect with CSS & JS and no other dependencies
